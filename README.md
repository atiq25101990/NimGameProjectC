# NimGameProjectC
This project is a third iteration (Project C) of a existing nim game project in unimelb

The aim of this project is to add some more advanced features to the system developed in Project B.
The features to be added are:
* Handling of invalid input via Exceptions
* Write (read) the game statistics into (from) a file, i.e., one which is stored on the hard disk between
executions of Nimsys
* A new type of player - an AI (Articial Intelligence) player, whose moves are automatically deter-
mined by the computer rather than a game user
* A victory guaranteed strategy for the AI player
* An advanced Nim game and a victory guaranteed strategy for the AI player in this new game (for
bonus marks)

The system should still operate as specified in Project B (refer to ProjB.pdf for details), but with ad-
ditional functionality, due to the addition of the aforementioned features. Thus, it is advised that you
use your Project B solution as a starting point for implementing Project C.
